# Fitness-Based Growth of Directed Networks with Hierarchy


This code based on the work during my PhD can be used to generate directed networks using combinations of prefential attachment based on degree and node fitness interactions. 

The code is divided into many varaints of the model using different fitness functions, to analyse the structure of a single network or many. In a way that was convient to generate the figures for reserach work. Most of the jupyter notebooks contain repeated base code with some feature changed to the one which they intended to analyse. Example figures are also left in the jupyter notebook but not neccarisly the ones used in the submitted work as these can be reproduced by changing the parameters in the code to match the ones listed in the paper. Any code for any fitness function can be easily modified to fit the required function just by changing it and any code labelled for a spefic function will contain commmented expressions of other possible fucntions.

I can be contacted on nxr081@student.bham.ac.uk until the end of my PhD in September 2024. If you have questions about the work after that date contact my co-author Samuel Johnson at s.johnson.4@bham.ac.uk
